To analyze skin lesion features accurately, we need to remove hair from the images, as it obstructs the lesions and affects feature analysis. To achieve this, we first reviewed all 200 skin lesion images and identified the types of image enhancements required for effective hair removal. This step is crucial because hair removal tools perform better when hairs are more distinguishable. Moreover, the picture enhancement techniques help to better visualize skin lesion itself for better features detection. 

After manually analyzing the images, we present the following examples from our dataset that require image enhancement. Additionally, we specify the type of enhancement that can be applied to improve hair visibility for more efficient removal.

We presented our finding in the following table, together with the issues that might occur while performing image processing.
